            I designed one-page, in-depth looks at some projects I'm working on. I've always found it interesting to see how other people work. I hope someone finds how I work interesting.

        <p>
            The projects I've shown are done in my free time. For the day job, I'm in a rotational program at a Navy research center so I've worked on a few very cool projects. Unfortunately, I pretty much can't show what I've made. Most of my time has been spent with the center's User Centered Design group, where I'm lucky to be surrounded by people much smarter than I am.</p>
