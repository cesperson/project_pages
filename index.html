            I designed one-page, in-depth looks at some projects I'm working on. I'm always interested in seeing how other people work. I hope someone finds how I work interesting.

        <h2>Disaster Response System</h2>
        <img src="img/icbrne_threewide.png" class="no-border">
        <p>
        Using Omnigraffle, I wireframed a potential mobile app for a disaster response system. In the existing system, hazardous material sensors transfer gathered data to a station on the same wifi network. That local system then converts the proprietary sensor data to the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) format. In CAP form, the alerts are distributed to federal, civil, and private emergency operations agencies. The mobile app would allow users to view sensor live readings, read sensor alert information, and send out simulated sensor alarms.

        <h2>365 Daily Design Project</h2>
        <p>
           As with 365 daily photograph projects, I tried to write and design a page layout each day. Writing or designing something every day is hard enough alone, so trying to do both was a little too lofty a goal. The point of these projects is to establish consistency and quantity over quality---eventually quality improves because you're getting so many reps in. And even though I only got through about a month, I did create a few pages that I really like.

        <h3>Final Fantasy V Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
            For this day, I wrote about the greatest accomplishment of my life: beating a Japanese copy of Final Fantasy V in elementary school. It was still a few years away from an English release so I had no access to English guides. The only way to advance the story was through brute exploration. I'm guessing there were guides online, but the internet basically didn't exist to me then. Other things that didn't quite exist: my social life, girls.</p>

        <p>
            Most of the projects shown here were done in my free time. At the day job, I'm in a rotational program at a Navy research center so I've worked on a few very cool projects. Unfortunately, I pretty much can't show what I've made. Most of my time has been spent with the center's User Centered Design group, where I'm lucky to be surrounded by people much smarter than I am.</p>
